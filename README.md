Sorting Visualization Project
Overview
Welcome to the Sorting Visualization Project! This project is a dynamic and interactive tool that visualizes various sorting algorithms, helping users to understand how these algorithms work in real-time. Itâ€™s perfect for both beginners learning sorting algorithms and experienced developers looking to get a deeper understanding of their performance.

Features
Interactive Visualization: Watch the sorting algorithms in action, step by step.
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualize various algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
Customizable Array Size: Adjust the size of the array to see how different algorithms perform with different data volumes.
Speed Control: Modify the speed of the visualization to match your learning pace.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design with easy-to-use controls.

Steps
 1. Clone the Repository:
git clone (https://github.com/damini8arora/shorting-visualization-).git
cd sorting-visualization

2. Install Dependencies:
 npm install
3. Run the Project:
npm start
Usage
Select an Algorithm: Choose the sorting algorithm you wish to visualize from the dropdown menu.
Generate Array: Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new set of random numbers.
Adjust Speed: Use the speed slider to control the speed of the sorting process.
Start Sorting: Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization. Watch as the algorithm sorts the array in real-time.



Sorting Algorithms Implemented
Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Selection Sort: Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region to move to the sorted region.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly taking the next item and inserting it into its correct position.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and merges them back together.
Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot, recursively sorting the sub-arrays.
